Welcome to our Hack 112 submission (INSERT NAME), an application that focuses on emphasizing the importance of taking care of yourself :) 

The premis of this application is to display how an individual's daily actions impact their health and wellbeing using a virtual robot simulation.

2. How much have you eaten today?"
3. Have you drunk water today?
4. How much have you slept today?
5. Have you exercised today?
6. Have you spent time with friends or family today?
7. Have you gone outside today?
8. Have you meditated today?

The user can answer a question with just the simple click of a button. Some of the answers can be a simple "yes" or "no", while other answers have multiple ranges to select from. Every answer comes with an amount of "People Points" which are added to a score to determine how the robot appears on the screen.
